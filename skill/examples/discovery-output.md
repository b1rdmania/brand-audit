# Willow Leather — Discovery Report
Generated: February 2026

---

## What Jumped Out

1. **Zero external reviews.** Judge.me is installed on the site, so customers are leaving reviews — but only people who've already found the website can see them. No Google reviews (no listing), no Trustpilot, nothing. Two of the three closest competitors have 15-60 reviews across Google and Trustpilot. This is the single biggest gap.

2. **No Pinterest.** For a brand selling beautiful handmade leather bags and accessories — a visual, gift-friendly product — this is a major missed channel. Both competitors with larger Instagram followings have active Pinterest accounts. Pinterest users are actively looking for things to buy; Instagram users are scrolling.

3. **The product is better than the website.** The halfmoon crossbody bags are distinctive. The marbled leather technique is unusual. The cactus vegan leather is a genuine talking point. But the Shopify site (Brooklyn theme — one of the older free themes) doesn't reflect any of this. Product titles are stuffed with "Best Handmade Leather..." keyword padding. The blog has 2 posts. Press features in Country Living and Hertfordshire Life aren't mentioned anywhere on the site.

4. **Strong distribution, weak owned presence.** She sells through her own site, Not On The High Street (3 years), Holly & Co (65 products), Ankorstore wholesale, a retail stockist (Radical Living), and Top Drawer trade shows. That's impressive for one person. But almost all customer discovery happens through those marketplaces, not through her own channels. If NOTHS changes its algorithm or raises its commission, there's no safety net.

## The Business

**Willow Leather** is a handmade leather goods brand run by **Amber Willow** from her studio in Hertfordshire. She founded it in 2019. She designs and makes everything herself — this is genuinely a one-woman operation.

Amber has a Fashion Design degree from Northampton University and previously taught secondary school textiles. She chose craft over mass production.

**What she sells:** Leather bags, accessories, and personalised gifts. The range runs from £10.50 leather bookmarks to £186 signature halfmoon crossbody bags. Materials are vegetable-tanned Italian leather and Nopal cactus vegan leather. Personalisation is available on most products.

**Where she sells:**
- [willow-leather.com](https://willow-leather.com) — own Shopify website
- [Not On The High Street](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/partners/willow) — 3 years on the platform
- [Holly & Co](https://holly.co/storefront/willow-leather) — 65 products listed, "Female Founded" badge
- [Ankorstore](https://www.ankorstore.com) — wholesale for trade buyers
- [Radical Living](https://radicalliving.co.uk) — retail stockist
- [Top Drawer](https://www.topdrawer.co.uk/a-z-brands-/willow-leather) — Launchpad selection S/S26, confirmed for September 2026

## The Website

**Platform:** Shopify, running the Brooklyn theme (one of Shopify's older free themes — it works but looks dated for a product at this price point).

**Pages:** ~30 total — products, collections, about page, contact, 2 blog posts.

**Meta title:** "Maker of handmade leather bags & accessories" — clear, but not all product and collection pages appear to have descriptions.

**Product titles are keyword-stuffed.** Every product starts with "Best" — e.g., "Best Handmade Leather Large Halfmoon Shoulder Bag." This looks spammy to both customers and search engines. The bags are handmade and beautiful; they don't need the word "Best" in front of them.

**The blog has 2 posts.** "My Exciting News" and one about US shipping. Two posts is worse than none — it looks like something that was started and dropped.

**No "As featured in" section** despite real press credentials (Country Living, Hertfordshire Life, The Homeworker). No mention of the Top Drawer Launchpad selection on the site.

**No press page.** The credentials exist but they're invisible.

**Scripts running:** Google Tag Manager, Judge.me (reviews), hCaptcha, Adoric (popup), NFCube, Instagram feed widget. That's heavy for a small store — worth running a speed test.

**Contact:** Email and contact form exist. Shipping and personalisation turnaround times aren't prominently displayed — for handmade-to-order products, customers (especially gift buyers) need to know how long things take.

**Email capture:** Adoric popup is installed, which suggests some email collection. Unclear what tool manages the list (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Shopify Email).

**Structured data:** Standard Shopify Product schema likely present by default. Not checked in detail.

## What People Find When They Search

**"Willow Leather"** — the own website and NOTHS listing appear. Holly & Co listing appears. Instagram appears. No Google Business listing. Some third-party directories list a Welwyn Garden City address but there's no claimed profile.

**"Handmade leather bag UK"** — Willow Leather does not appear in the first page of results. Not enough content for search engines to rank the site for category searches.

**"Cactus leather bag UK"** — this is a niche search with real potential, but the site has no dedicated content about cactus leather. No ranking.

**AI visibility:** Asked Perplexity "best handmade leather bag makers in the UK" — Willow Leather does not appear. There isn't enough written content about the brand for AI tools to reference.

**Watch out:** "WillowCreekLeatherCo" on Etsy is a different business based in the US. Not related — but could cause confusion if someone searches carelessly.

## Where They Exist Online

### [Instagram — @willow.leather](https://www.instagram.com/willow.leather/)
~4,695 followers. This is the primary (and only) social channel. Bio says "Works in Leather" and mentions Country Living and Hertfordshire Life features. Links to the website. The feed shows the products well — good photography of the bags, some making-process content. For a brand that's been going since 2019, the following is solid but modest. Posting appears regular.

### [Not On The High Street](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/partners/willow)
Active for 3 years. Established marketplace presence. Product listings with pricing. NOTHS handles its own reviews — worth checking if there are reviews here that aren't visible elsewhere.

### [Holly & Co](https://holly.co/storefront/willow-leather)
65 products listed. "Female Founded" badge. Holly Tucker (who founded Not On The High Street) runs this platform — being listed here is a genuine endorsement in the UK maker community.

### [Top Drawer — Exhibitor Profile](https://www.topdrawer.co.uk/a-z-brands-/willow-leather)
Selected for the Launchpad emerging talent section at S/S26 (Stand 111, Olympia London, January 2026). Confirmed for the September 2026 edition. This is the UK's biggest gift and lifestyle trade show — the Launchpad selection is a real stamp of approval.

### [Radical Living](https://radicalliving.co.uk)
Retail stockist carrying Willow Leather bags. Physical shop presence.

### Ankorstore
Wholesale channel for trade buyers. Listed but no public-facing profile URL found.

## Where They Don't Exist

**Pinterest** — No profile. This matters. Pinterest is where people search for gift ideas, save things they want to buy, and discover brands like this. Both competitors with larger Instagram followings have active Pinterest accounts. For a visual product brand selling bags, accessories, and personalised gifts, Pinterest is probably the highest-value channel she's not on.

**Google Business** — No claimed listing. Third-party directories show a Welwyn Garden City address but there's no actual Google Business Profile. This means no Google reviews, no Google Maps presence, no knowledge panel when someone searches the business name.

**Trustpilot** — No profile. No external reviews anywhere.

**Etsy** — No shop. Given that she's already on NOTHS and Holly & Co, adding another marketplace may not be the priority — but Etsy has a larger audience for handmade goods, especially internationally.

**Facebook** — No business page. For a solo maker primarily reaching customers through Instagram and marketplaces, this is low priority.

**TikTok** — No presence. Craft process videos (leather cutting, stitching, marbling) could do well here, but only if Amber enjoys making short-form video. Not worth forcing for a one-woman operation.

**LinkedIn** — No business page. Low priority — not where her customers are.

**YouTube** — No channel. Low priority.

**Press page on the website** — Despite real features in Country Living and Hertfordshire Life, there's no press page and no "As seen in" section. These credentials are invisible to anyone visiting the site.

## What Customers Are Saying

**External reviews: zero.** No Google reviews, no Trustpilot, no Facebook reviews. The only customer feedback exists on-site via Judge.me — invisible to anyone who hasn't already found the website.

**Fragments found through research:**
- "Excellent quality leather"
- "Addicted to the accessories"
- Quick service noted

These are positive but scattered. There's no single place a prospective customer can go to read what other buyers think. For a product brand, especially one selling at £100+, this is a real barrier to conversion.

**NOTHS reviews:** Worth checking — NOTHS has its own review system that may contain testimonials not visible elsewhere.

## Competitor Comparison

| | [Willow Leather](https://willow-leather.com) | [Competitor A](https://example.com) | [Competitor B](https://example.com) | [Competitor C](https://example.com) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Website** | Shopify (Brooklyn — dated) | Shopify (modern theme) | Squarespace | Shopify |
| **Instagram** | 4,695 | ~12,000 | ~8,500 | ~2,800 |
| **Pinterest** | **Missing** | Active (~2k) | Active (~950) | Missing |
| **Google Business** | **Missing** | 4.7 (38 reviews) | 4.9 (15 reviews) | Missing |
| **Trustpilot** | **Missing** | 4.8 (22 reviews) | Missing | Missing |
| **Etsy** | Missing | Active (500+ sales) | Missing | Active (200+ sales) |
| **Blog / content** | 2 posts | ~15 posts | ~8 posts | None |
| **Total external reviews** | **0** | **60** | **15** | **0** |

**What this shows:** Willow Leather has the strongest marketplace distribution of the group — NOTHS, Holly & Co, Ankorstore, and trade shows. No competitor has that breadth. But the two competitors with larger Instagram followings both have Pinterest, Google reviews, and regular blog content. The review gap is the starkest: Competitor A has 60 external reviews to Willow Leather's zero. Competitor C is in a similar position — small, no reviews, no Pinterest — which suggests this is the norm for brands at this stage, not an unusual failing. But Competitors A and B show what "the next level" looks like, and it starts with reviews and Pinterest.

## Press & Credentials

- **Country Living** — featured (mentioned in Instagram bio; exact article not located)
- **Hertfordshire Life** — featured (mentioned in Instagram bio)
- **The Homeworker** — featured
- **Top Drawer Launchpad** — selected for S/S26 emerging talent section, confirmed Sep 2026
- **Holly & Co "Female Founded" badge**
- **Fashion Design degree, Northampton University** — relevant craft credential
- **Ex-secondary school textiles teacher** — adds to the maker story

All of this is real and none of it appears on the website. No press page, no "As featured in" section, no mention of Top Drawer on the homepage.

## Things to Investigate Further

- **NOTHS reviews:** Check whether there are reviews on the Not On The High Street listing that aren't visible elsewhere. These could be quoted on the own website.
- **Judge.me review count:** How many on-site reviews exist? If there are 50+ good reviews trapped on the Shopify site, the priority is getting some onto external platforms too.
- **Adoric popup / email list:** Is there actually an email list being built? What tool? How many subscribers? This affects the "build an email list" recommendation.
- **PageSpeed:** The six third-party scripts suggest the site may be slow on mobile. Worth running the actual test before recommending script removal.
- **Personalisation workflow:** How long does a personalised order take vs standard? This affects what the product pages should say about dispatch times.
- **Country Living feature:** Can the actual article be found? A link to a Country Living feature is worth more than just the logo.
