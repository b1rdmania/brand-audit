# Competitor Comparison — Reference

## Finding Competitors

Ask Perplexity something specific. Not "who are their competitors" — describe the business and what you're looking for:

> "I'm looking at a handmade leather bag brand called Willow Leather, based in Hertfordshire, UK. They sell through their own website and Not On The High Street, priced £10-£186. Who are 3-5 similar brands — similar size, similar products, selling in the UK? I need their website URLs."

The more context you give, the better the results. Mention the price range, the market, the business model. Ask for brands of similar size — comparing a solo maker against Mulberry isn't useful.

## What to Check

For each competitor, look at the same things you looked at for the main business — but lighter. You're building a comparison, not running a full audit. Focus on whatever channels turned out to matter most for the main business.

The comparison is only useful if it reveals something. "All four businesses have Instagram" isn't a finding. "You're the only one of four without Google reviews" is.

## How to Present It

A table works well for the raw numbers. But the table alone isn't enough — write a short narrative underneath explaining what the comparison actually means. Where does the business lead? Where is it behind? What does "behind" look like in practice — is it a small gap or a chasm?

Link to competitor profiles in the table so the business owner can go look themselves.

Bold or mark the cells where the main business is notably behind — make the gaps visible at a glance.

See `examples/discovery-output.md` for a worked example.
